#alarmclock
This is one of the interesting python project ideas.
People all across the globe use alarm clock applications. 
However, this project isn't your run-of-the-mill alarm clock.
Our application lets us input a text file containing YouTube links. If we set a particular time in the alarm clock,
it will randomly select a YouTube link from the text file and play that video.
