#alarmclock
This is one of the interesting python project ideas.
People all across the globe use alarm clock applications. 
However, this project isn't your run-of-the-mill alarm clock. In this application, you can 
input YouTube links in a text file and design the application to read the file.
If you set a particular time in the alarm clock, it will pick a random YouTube link from the 
text file and play the YouTube video.
